# Tips and Tricks:

- Can run js directly in terminal with "node test.js"
- can log two item at the same time separated with comma.
- `x = x + 10 same as x += 10`
- `x = x + 1 same as x ++`
- To start a new line(multiline) use "\n\" or ``

```javascript
console.log(
	"My name is Manab \n\
  I am 22 years old"
);
// can just use `` for multiline
console.log(`My name is Manab
  I am 22 years old`);
```
